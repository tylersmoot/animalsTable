# animalsTable
A simple table that includes animal names and type, users can add animals to the table and it populates an id for each animal
This was a project I started to learn more about, and practice with objects by adding data from objects directly to the html page by utilizing the dom
This project takes user input in the form of two input fields, once the user submits the information, it populates the table with the new information
